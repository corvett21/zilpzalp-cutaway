## WARNING: WIP!
Nothing in this repository has been tested (yet). There is no firmware available (yet). Get anything manufactured at your own risk!

## Inspiration
- the [aptmak](https://github.com/apsu/aptmak) keymap
- the [hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) keyboard and the [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae#rufous) variation
- all the fantastic keyboards, knowledge, and help by [GEIST](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/), [Freya](https://linktr.ee/freya_irl), [Bob](https://github.com/GroooveBob), and the wonderful Clacktales keyboard community
