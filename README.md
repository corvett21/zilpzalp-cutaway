# zilpzalp
A wonky 28-key, column-staggered, unibody-split keyboard made with fantastic FOSS software: [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

Two versions are available:
- the version with support for optional hotswap sockets and slightly extended edgecuts to acommodate the extra space required by the socket (in the [pcb]() directory)
- the solder-only version with tighter edge cuts (in the [solder_only_pcb]() directory)

## WARNING: WIP!
Nothing in this repository has been tested (yet). There is no firmware available (yet). Get anything manufactured at your own risk!

## Inspiration
- all the fantastic keyboards, knowledge, and help by [GEIST](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/), [Freya](https://linktr.ee/freya_irl), [Bob](https://github.com/GroooveBob), and the wonderful Clacktales keyboard community
- the [hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) keyboard and the [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae#rufous) variation
- the [aptmak](https://github.com/apsu/aptmak) keymap
