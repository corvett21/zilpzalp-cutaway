A wonky 28-key, column-staggered, unibody-split keyboard made with fantastic FOSS software: [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and [kicad](https://www.kicad.org/).

## WARNING: WIP!
Nothing in this repository has been tested (yet). There is no firmware available (yet). Getting anything manufactured is at your own risk!

## Inspiration
- the [aptmak](https://github.com/apsu/aptmak) keymap
- the [hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) keyboard and the [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae#rufous) variation
- all the fantastic keyboards by [GEIST](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/) and [Freya](https://linktr.ee/freya_irl)
